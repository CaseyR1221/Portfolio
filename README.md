# Portfolio

This project required me to use my new found knowlegde of HTML and CSS flex-box in order to create my very first portfolio page! While it definitley took some thought, i feel that it went very well for my first attempt. It consists of seperate sections for an "about me", my projects i've completed, ways to contact me, and a link to my resume.

Below you will find a screenshot.
