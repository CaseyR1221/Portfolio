                <p>I have put quite a bit of thought over the past few years into what I would like to do with my life, and I feel

                    professional striving to acquire a comprehensive set of software development skills in order to broaden the range of projects 
                    that I may work on. I aspire to become a competent and dependable mobile developer so that I may contribute fully within my 
                    given field, and act as a fountain of information to those around me who are less knowledgeable. 
                    My personal goals aside from those pertaining to my career are to maintain a healthy and active lifestyle 
                    through regular exercise and sports, and to be happy with my appearance at all times.</p>
